\section*{Abstract}
Design by contract is a popular design pattern that has been widely used to increase the reliability of software systems. This kind of programming paradigm requires the programmers to provide formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components\cite{wiki:dbc}. Dafny\cite{dafny1} is such a language that enables programmers to provide contracts for various program constructs and the tool with the same name can verify functional correctness of programs written in this language. The author of this report used dafny to develop and verify the correctness of operations on a singly-linkedlist, including insert, delete, get, indexOf, update. All the operations were implemented in iterative fashion (use loops instead of recursion). For most of the operations, the author also came up with a recursive version which required much fewer efforts to develop and can be proved by Dafny much faster compared to the iterative counterpart. The author also made a small contribution to the Dafny project by reporting a small bug in dafny script (see http://dafny.codeplex.com/workitem/90).
