\section*{Evaluation}
The Dafny software used in this project was built from source, and the dafny code that I developed was tested both on windows and ubuntu system.\\

The most reliable way to reproduce the results is to verify the programs on ubuntu system, because I noticed that some complex program (specifically, the one related to delete operation) can only be proved efficiently on Ubuntu platform.

Most operations/lemmas can be verified in several seconds, some more complex may need longer but usually not exceeding half a minute.\\

Comparing with recursive approach, iterative approach is more complex and potentially slower for verification. The rationale of implementing the code in iterative fashion is that the iterative approach is more efficient in execution; and deliver a verified version of the iterative implementation is quite attractive because we only need to verify the code once and then we can trustfully use it since then.
